# Article and Journal search (AJsearch) - web application (Flask)

AJsearch is the web application for searching academic articles or journals. The app aims to support researchers or readers to search for articles or journals that are relevant to their desired topics. 

The project includes 4 main components to build such as data crawling pipeline, recommended models, api and user interface. 
* Data will be crawled from [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/), and the code can be extended to crawl other websites.
* Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques will be used to build and evaluate the recommended model respectively.

## Tasks
- [ ] Crawl data from arXiv
- [ ] Implement data models and connect Azure SQL Database
- [ ] Implement automated data crawling pipeline
- [ ] Implement and experiment recommended models
- [ ] Build API for getting data and running the recommended model
- [ ] Design and implement User Interface
